Our project aims to learn from US employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The BLS offers monthly and quarterly labor force and wage statistics, and we’ll use this as our main dataset. If available, we plan to compare regional data to Zillow’s home rental/ownership information via Zillow’s API. Finally, we’re investigating using per-state Google Trends data to observe how employment-related search queries vary in the context of employment data.

Data sources:
Bureau of Labor Statistics
Zillow
Google Trends

Some questions we might answer
How does pay relate to rent prices?
How does home ownership rate fluctuate with employment rate?
How do job-related Google queries track against employment rate?
